'* Mike's Trial Counter
	'* By: Mike Canejo


	This is an example on how to make
your programs have a trial counter on it.
This example uses VB's "SaveSetting" and "GetSetting"
to write to the .EXE itself the number of times the
program was opened. I made a function in here to detect
how many times it was open and if the number of times
open is greater than the number you specify, then it
displays a "Trial Over" message and exits the program.
And also, if you wanted to add a "Register" part, I 
Included a "Reset TrialCount" feature so if they
register it, make it "Registered" and stop the trial
count. This is perfect if your working on a program and 
want it to be Shareware. Questions goto: Mike@dev-center.com
