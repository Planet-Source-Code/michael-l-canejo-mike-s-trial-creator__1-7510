### Description

This is an example on how to make your programs have a trial counter on it.This example uses VB's "SaveSetting" and "GetSetting" to the number of times the program was opened. I made a function in here to detect

how many times it was open and if the number of times open is greater than the number you specify, then it displays a "Trial Over" message and exits the program. And also, if you wanted to add a "Register" part, I Included a "Reset TrialCount" feature so if they register it, make it "Registered" and stop the trial count. This is perfect if your working on a program and want it to be Shareware.
